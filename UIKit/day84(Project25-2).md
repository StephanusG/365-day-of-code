# Day84 - Completed but working status unknown. <a href="https://github.com/devmehmetates/365-day-of-code/tree/main/Project/Day83-84/Day83-84"> Project </a>
I got errors even though I did the same things done in the lesson. Therefore, there is no way for me to do the challenges when the project is not working correctly. Unfortunately, the project did not work properly even though I did research and experiments on the internet. This reason has unfortunately been passed today. If I continue my research and find a solution, I will come back and edit this place.

## Note
I found other solutions, but even they were not enough to run my project. I think it's a problem with my internet connection, but I couldn't find a solution.

## Note2 
All the challenges were done on the file, but I have no clue whether it works or not.
