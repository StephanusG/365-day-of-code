## Basic Swift debugging using print()
The beginning of everything and sometimes our life saver in software. Print()

```swift
print (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, separator: "-")
print("Super mege message", terminator: "**")
```

## Debugging with assert()
A claim check. Work if the claim is true, crash if not. That's why line 2 has been commented out :)
```swift
assert(1==1, "Math Error!")
// assert(1==2, "Math Error!")
```

## Debugging with breakpoints
A for loop that appears. But there is a break-point in it and it stops the application every 10 runs. <a href="https://github.com/devmehmetates/365-day-of-code/tree/main/Project/Day64-65/Day64-65"> Examine it. </a>

```swift
for i in 1 ... 100 {
    print("Got number \(i)")
}
```

## View debugging
It's a kind of debugging that we do via Xcode, very independent of the project and the code.
