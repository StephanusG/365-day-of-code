## Developing on Instruments

## Subjects
+ Setting up
+ What are we working with?
+ What can Instruments tell us?
+ Fixing the bugs: slow shadows
+ Fixing the bugs: wasted allocations

## Summary
Hello everyone. Since we have learned to use instruments today, there is no subject to prepare a file. For this reason, I recommend you to follow the hacking with swift resource.

## Happy Coding :)
