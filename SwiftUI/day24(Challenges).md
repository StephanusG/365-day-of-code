# Day 24 <a href="https://github.com/devmehmetates/365-day-of-code/tree/main/SwiftUI/Projects/ViewsAndModifiers/ViewsAndModifiers"> Project </a>

## Basic Challenges

## Subjects

+ Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.
+ Go back to project 2 and replace the Image view used for flags with a new FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
+ Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.

## Note
These are really easy challenges. So I'm sure you can understand them all through commit.
