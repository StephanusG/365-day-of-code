# Day 21-22 <a href="https://github.com/devmehmetates/365-day-of-code/tree/main/SwiftUI/Projects/Guess%20the%20Flag/Guess%20the%20Flag"> Project </a>

## SwiftUI fundamentals and shapes

## Subjects

+ Stacking up buttons
+ Showing the player’s score with an alert
+ Styling our flags
+ Upgrading our design

## Challenges
+ Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.
+ When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
+ Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.

## Information
Today I will do the same as yesterday. And probably after that too. Now our files are embedded in our code. This is less tiring for me and more explanatory for you. If you do not want this style, please specify it by submitting an issue.
