# Information about projects documents
I've noticed lately that I can do better with spending more time on code. That's why I decided to take a break from the documents for a while (possibly until chapter 3). I want to improve my code quality and dedicate this time to research and projects I do for you. You can view daily project activities, images and videos related to projects on twitter and follow me.

Here is my twitter link if that works for you! <a href="https://twitter.com/devmehmetates">❤️ Click me</a>

And one more news! In the near future, I will attach many images and demo videos related to the projects to the files of the projects. Stay healthy!
