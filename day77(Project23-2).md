## Developing on SpriteKit

## Important announcement
Greetings again. We are facing another day with very long codes. There is a lot of new information and it's all about the sprite kit. This is why it takes more than 1 hour to complete the lessons and write their codes. That's why I'm passing today as I mentioned yesterday. And again I apologize. I will be with you tomorrow with a full challenge file. Thank you for your understanding.


## Happy Coding :)
