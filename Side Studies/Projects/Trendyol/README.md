<h1 align="center">Trendyol Clone</h1>
The purpose of these projects is to clone the UI of Trendyol iOS application, one of the leading companies in Turkey, and improve my skills. Projects will have two sections, UIKit and SwiftUI. I will look for an answer to the question of how to develop exactly the same views with two frameworks. In this project process, the development stages are as follows.

# Development
+ Create a sign in and edit screen with userdefaults
+ Create a discovery screen with page view
+ Create a detail screen
+ Create a favorite screen
+ Create a basket screen

## Progress
+ Do the same things for both platforms. By the end of the day, both platforms should be in the same state.
+ Try mixing it! You can try using swiftUI in UIKit and UIKit in SwiftUI.
+ Keep the service files exactly the same. So you can get the exact equivalents within the app.
+ Don't be fooled by the design! Our goal is to do exactly the same. Don't try to change!
+ We are free because we have nothing on assets!
+ ## Force yourself! It must have been a really tough fight. Don't try to take it easy!

## Time limitation
+ The application should really be made as if you are working in a company. Perfectionism is our bane. We have to get over this! That's why we have a start and end date.

The 3rd week of May looks good to me. And I give myself a maximum of 2 months to complete the development. Until the project start time, I have to create a json file and make the necessary preparation for the data. The start date may be delayed due to my exams or additional work. But the deadline cannot be more than 2 months.

## Things to pay attention!
+ Installing a clean MVVM build.
+ Responsive design
+ Services
+ Performance
+ Magic number uses
+ Atomic and reusable UI's
